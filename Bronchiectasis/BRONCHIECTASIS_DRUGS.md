| **Bronchodilators - LABA** | Long-acting beta-agonists | Bronchodilation, improves airflow | Used in 39% of bronchiectasis patients; higher use in patients with bronchodilator response (BDR) |
| **Bronchodilators - LAMA** | Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (e.g., Tiotropium) | Anticholinergic bronchodilation | Improves lung function in patients with airflow obstruction; FEV1 improvement particularly in baseline FEV1 < 50% |
| **Bronchodilators - SABA** | Short-acting beta-agonists (e.g., Salbutamol) | Rapid bronchodilation for symptom relief | Used as rescue medication; increased use in bronchiectasis with bronchodilator response |

## Key Findings

### 1. Novel Therapies
- **Brensocatib (CHF-6333)** represents a breakthrough as the first FDA-approved disease-modifying drug for bronchiectasis (August 2025)
- Targets the underlying inflammatory mechanism rather than just treating symptoms

### 2. CFTR Modulators
- Showing promise not only in CF-related bronchiectasis but potentially in non-CF bronchiectasis with CFTR mutations
- Elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor demonstrated significant reduction in bronchiectasis volumes

### 3. Optimal Dosing
- N-acetylcysteine at **1200 mg/day** significantly more effective than 600 mg/day in:
  - Reducing exacerbations (-48.6%)
  - Reducing hospitalizations (-29.9%)
  - Reducing total exacerbation rates (-54.1%)
  - Decreasing sputum volume

### 4. Combination Therapy
- Most effective treatment involves combining antibiotics with anti-inflammatory agents
- For disseminated pulmonary nocardiosis: intensive combination therapy for at least 3 weeks is mandatory

### 5. Emerging Research
- Host-directed therapies targeting neutrophil activation and inflammation showing promise
- Chinese herbal medicines demonstrating efficacy through multiple pathways
- Network pharmacology approaches identifying novel therapeutic targets

### 6. Bronchodilator Use in Bronchiectasis
- **Prevalence**: 39% of bronchiectasis patients use inhaled bronchodilators
- **Bronchodilator Response (BDR)**: Observed in 7.3% of bronchiectasis patients
  - BDR defined as FEV1 or FVC improvement ≥200 mL and ≥12% after bronchodilator
  - Associated with worse baseline lung function (FEV1% 52.7% vs. 65.3% in non-BDR)
  - Linked to more severe disease, higher exacerbation rates, and increased hospitalizations
- **LAMA Therapy**: 
  - Tiotropium shows significant FEV1 improvement in patients with lower baseline lung function
  - Greater benefit in patients with FEV1 < 50% predicted (OR 3.5 for positive response)
  - Improved post-bronchodilator FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratio in COPD-bronchiectasis overlap
- **ICS-Containing Agents**: More frequently used in patients with BDR
- **Clinical Significance**: BDR serves as an independent predictor of bronchiectasis severity and may guide therapeutic decisions

### 7. Personalized Approach
Treatment selection depends on:
- Underlying etiology (CF vs. non-CF)
- Infection status (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, NTM, Nocardia)
- Comorbidities (obesity, rhinoconjunctivitis, nasal polyps)
- Disease severity and exacerbation frequency
- Presence of bronchodilator response and degree of airflow obstruction

## Common Pathogens and Targeted Therapies

### Most Common Pathogens in Bronchiectasis:
1. **Pseudomonas aeruginosa** - Most common, requires targeted antibiotic therapy
2. **Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM)** - Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)
3. **Haemophilus influenzae**
4. **Aspergillus** - Fungal pathogen
5. **Nocardia terpenica** - Less common but important to recognize

### Pathogen-Specific Treatments:
- **Pseudomonas**: Fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, carbapenems
- **MAC**: Sitafloxacin-containing regimens, bedaquiline (for refractory cases)
- **Nocardia**: TMP-SMX, imipenem/cilastatin (combination therapy)
- **Fungal coinfections**: Triazoles/azoles

## Treatment Considerations

### Benefits:
- Reduced exacerbation frequency
- Improved quality of life
- Better lung function preservation
- Reduced hospitalization rates
- Bronchodilators improve airflow and exercise tolerance in patients with airflow obstruction

### Risks and Monitoring:
- **Inhaled corticosteroids**: Associated with increased lung cancer risk with prolonged use
- **Antibiotics**: Risk of antimicrobial resistance
- **Long-term therapy**: Requires careful monitoring of adverse effects
- **Bronchodilators**: 
  - Generally well-tolerated
  - LAMA may be associated with dry mouth, urinary retention
  - LABA may cause tremor, tachycardia, hypokalemia
  - Monitor for paradoxical bronchospasm
  - Assess response with spirometry to guide continued use

## Future Directions

1. **Host-directed therapies**: Targeting immune dysfunction and excessive inflammation
2. **Precision medicine**: Genetic testing to guide CFTR modulator therapy
3. **Novel antimicrobials**: Development of new agents for drug-resistant infections
4. **Combination strategies**: Optimizing drug combinations for better outcomes
5. **Bronchodilator phenotyping**: Identifying patients most likely to benefit from bronchodilator therapy based on BDR testing and baseline lung function
6. **Dual bronchodilation**: Exploring the role of LABA/LAMA combinations in bronchiectasis with significant airflow obstruction
