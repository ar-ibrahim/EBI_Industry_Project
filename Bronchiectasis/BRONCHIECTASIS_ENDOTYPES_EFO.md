## Inflammatory Endotypes

### 1. Neutrophilic Bronchiectasis
- **EFO ID:** EFO:0920035
- **IRI:** http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0920035
- **Definition:** A bronchiectasis inflammatory endotype characterized by excessive neutrophil-driven airway inflammation with elevated levels of neutrophil-associated mediators including neutrophil elastase (NE), IL-8, and TNF-alpha. This is the most common inflammatory phenotype of bronchiectasis, strongly associated with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, severe disease, frequent exacerbations, and poor prognosis.

### 2. Eosinophilic Bronchiectasis
- **EFO ID:** EFO:0920036
- **IRI:** http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0920036
- **Definition:** A bronchiectasis inflammatory endotype characterized by elevated blood eosinophils (≥300 cells/μL) or sputum eosinophils (≥3%), associated with type 2 (Th2) inflammation, elevated fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), and IL-5/IL-13 signaling. This phenotype affects approximately 20% of patients with bronchiectasis and may be responsive to inhaled corticosteroids and biologic agents targeting Th2 pathways.

### 3. Mixed Granulocytic Bronchiectasis
- **EFO ID:** EFO:0920037
- **IRI:** http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0920037
- **Definition:** A bronchiectasis inflammatory endotype characterized by concurrent neutrophilic and eosinophilic (type 2/Th2) inflammation, with co-expression of neutrophil-associated markers (neutrophil elastase, IL-8) and eosinophilic markers (IL-5, IL-13, FeNO). This endotype represents a distinct biological subgroup associated with increased exacerbation risk and potential responsiveness to combined therapeutic strategies.

### 4. Paucigranulocytic Bronchiectasis
- **EFO ID:** EFO:0920038
- **IRI:** http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0920038
- **Definition:** A bronchiectasis inflammatory endotype characterized by low levels of both neutrophils (<60%) and eosinophils (<3%) in the sputum, with reduced concentrations of inflammatory mediators including IL-8 and IL-13. This phenotype is associated with milder disease presentation on imaging and lower exacerbation burden, though it remains less well-characterized than other bronchiectasis endotypes.

## Mechanistic Endotypes

### 5. CFTR Dysfunction Bronchiectasis
- **EFO ID:** EFO:0920039
- **IRI:** http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0920039
- **Definition:** A bronchiectasis endotype characterized by cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) dysfunction that does not meet full diagnostic criteria for cystic fibrosis, typically presenting with elevated sweat chloride concentration (intermediate range 30-59 mmol/L), mucociliary clearance defects, and susceptibility to nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary infection. Patients may carry heterozygous CFTR mutations or have reduced CFTR function without detectable mutations, and may be candidates for CFTR modulator therapy.

### 6. Ciliary Dysfunction Bronchiectasis
- **EFO ID:** EFO:0920040
- **IRI:** http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0920040
- **Definition:** A bronchiectasis endotype characterized by ciliary dysfunction that does not meet full diagnostic criteria for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), typically presenting with abnormally low nasal nitric oxide levels, ciliary beat frequency abnormalities, and impaired mucociliary clearance. This endotype represents a spectrum of ciliopathy-associated bronchiectasis distinct from classical PCD.

### 7. Heritable Connective Tissue Disorder-Associated Bronchiectasis
- **EFO ID:** EFO:0920041
- **IRI:** http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0920041
- **Definition:** A bronchiectasis endotype associated with heritable connective tissue disorder features, characterized by a tall asthenic morphotype with high rates of scoliosis, pectus excavatum, mitral valve prolapse, and dural ectasia. This endotype is associated with susceptibility to pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial infection and may involve genetic variation in connective tissue and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-related pathway genes.

### 8. Immune Deficient-Predominant Bronchiectasis
- **EFO ID:** EFO:0920042
- **IRI:** http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0920042
- **Definition:** A bronchiectasis endotype characterized by underlying immune deficiency, presenting with impaired systemic immunity and increased susceptibility to mycobacterial infection, particularly nontuberculous mycobacteria. This endotype encompasses a spectrum of primary and acquired immunodeficiencies that predispose to chronic airway infection and bronchiectatic disease.

## Summary

The EFO bronchiectasis endotype classification divides into two main categories:

### Inflammatory Endotypes (4 types)
Based on the dominant type of granulocytic inflammation:
- **Neutrophilic** - Most common, associated with chronic infection
- **Eosinophilic** - Type 2 inflammation, potentially responsive to targeted therapies
- **Mixed Granulocytic** - Combined neutrophilic and eosinophilic features
- **Paucigranulocytic** - Low inflammation, milder disease course

### Mechanistic Endotypes (4 types)
Based on underlying disease mechanisms:
- **CFTR Dysfunction** - CFTR-related but not meeting CF criteria
- **Ciliary Dysfunction** - Ciliopathy-related but not classical PCD
- **Connective Tissue Disorder** - Associated with heritable connective tissue features
- **Immune Deficient** - Primary or acquired immunodeficiency-related
