# EBI_Industry_Project
An EMBL-EBI industry programme project in partnership with AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Syngenta to harmonise disease ontologies for enhanced coverage and connectivity.
It aims to create a proof-of-concept application ontology with a clinical and molecular view of disease and to apply automated or partially automated AI processes for scaling up workflows.
